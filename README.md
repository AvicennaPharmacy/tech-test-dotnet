# Avicenna Tech Test

Congratulations on being invited to the paired programming exercise.

Before your interview you should:

- Set up your laptop with a suitable development environment.
Clone this repo, build it, and make sure it runs. You will need .NET Core SDK 3.1.

- You will be given details of the task on the day. It will require you to use an Avicenna API to present information about pharmacies. Please familiarise yourself with the API endpoint in advance, so we can make best use of your time when we start. This is available as a [Postman collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/b32ea6892ef0dc8cbfac) or you can simply use curl:
`` curl --location --request GET 'https://dev.api.managemymeds.co.uk/mobile/pharmacies' ``

## Getting Started

- Restore packages: `dotnet restore`
- Build it: `dotnet build`
- Run it: `dotnet run --project ./Avicenna.TechTest/Avicenna.TechTest/Avicenna.TechTest.csproj`

## Some notes

- You don't have to have a finished product! 
- We are interested in how you work and think.
- You can use any resources you want.
